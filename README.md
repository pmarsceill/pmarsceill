ðŸ‘‹ Hey there. I manage the _Code to Cloud_ Product Design team here at GitHub. We're responsible for making tools that allow developers to build, test, run, publish, deploy, and scale their work. If you're a GitHub user, you may have seen our efforts in GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages, and GitHub Pages. If you use these features and have feedback [open an issue here](https://github.com/pmarsceill/pmarsceill/issues/new) or [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pmarsceill).

In my time at GitHub, I have worked on almost every part of the product. I have managed teams or led design efforts on many core features like pull requests, code review, security, ecosystem / api, marketing / top-of-funnel, and new user experience.
